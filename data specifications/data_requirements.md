#  Data Requirements for PRISM Framework

>  **Note**: This framework assumes data preparation has already been completed.
> 
> The following input datasets are required to run the core stages of the PRISM pipeline:
> - Feature Engineering
> - Subgroup Discovery using EMM
> - Price Elasticity Forecasting using ARIMA
> - Price Recommendation
>
> These inputs reflect the format used in the original industrial implementation. Users can replace them with equivalent datasets that include:
> - Product-level transactional metrics
> - Price and cost history
> - Inflation adjustments

##  Dataset 1: `DataPreparationOutput.csv`

**Description**:  
Cleaned and enriched order-level transactional data. This file contains both raw input and engineered attributes merged from various sources, including order metadata, pricing, cost, OEM information, and supplier lead times.

##  Dataset 2: `InflationUpTo2025.csv`

**Description**:  
Official monthly inflation data from the European Central Bank, used to adjust nominal prices to real values (e.g., inflation-adjusted GLP).

###  Columns

| Column Name                                  | Type     | Description                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DATE`                                       | datetime | Start date of the inflation measurement period                     |
| `TIME PERIOD`                                | string   | Human-readable label for the time period (e.g., '2022-03')         |
| `HICP - Overall index (ICP.M.U2.N.000000.4.ANR)` | float    | Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area        |

**Usage Note**:  
Inflation values are used to compute adjusted price change ratios for elasticity calculation. Matching is typically done on order month/year or GLP active period.

##  Assumptions for Users

If you are not using these exact datasets:

- You must provide **a transactional dataset** where:
  - Product-level sales quantities and prices are timestamped
  - Each product has been sold under **at least two different price levels**
- You must provide an **inflation index** or disable inflation adjustment logic

See the notebook `Step 2 Aggregate Price Elasticity.ipynb` for examples on feature aggregation and price elasticity computations.
